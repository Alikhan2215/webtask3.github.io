  <p>The God of High School (갓 오브 하이 스쿨|ゴッド・オブ・ハイスクール, Gas Obeu Hai Seukul|Za Godo obu Hai
    Sukuru) is an anime adaptation based on the South Korean webtoon written and illustrated by Park
    Yongje. Japanese animation studio MAPPA produced the animated series in cooperation with Crunchyroll
    and Webtoon. It premiered on July 6th, 2020 on Japan's Tokyo MX and AT-X television stations and on
    Crunchyroll in all available regions.</p>

  <p>The "God of High School" tournament has begun, seeking out the greatest fighter among Korean high school
    students! All martial arts styles, weapons, means, and methods of attaining victory are permitted.
    The prize? One wish for anything desired by the winner. Taekwondo expert Jin Mo-Ri is invited to
    participate in the competition. There he befriends karate specialist Han Dae-Wi and swordswoman
    Yu Mi-Ra, who both have entered for their own personal reasons. Mo-Ri knows that no opponent will
    be the same and that the matches will be the most ruthless he has ever fought in his life. But instead
    of being worried, this prospect excites him beyond belief. A secret lies beneath the facade of a
    transparent test of combat prowess the tournament claims to be—one that has Korean political candidate
    Park Mu-Jin watching every fight with expectant, hungry eyes. Mo-Ri, Dae-Wi, and Mi-Ra are about to
    discover what it really means to become the God of High School.</p>
