      <p>Gabi Braun and Falco Grice have been training their entire lives to inherit one of the seven
        titans under Marley's control and aid their nation in eradicating the Eldians on Paradis. However,
        just as all seems well for the two cadets, their peace is suddenly shaken by the arrival of Eren
        Yeager and the remaining members of the Survey Corps. Having finally reached the Yeager family
        basement and learned about the dark history surrounding the titans, the Survey Corps has at long
        last found the answer they so desperately fought to uncover. With the truth now in their hands,
        the group set out for the world beyond the walls. In Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season, two
        utterly different worlds collide as each party pursues its own agenda in the long-awaited conclusion
        to Paradis' fight for freedom.</p>

      <p>The war for Paradis zeroes in on Shiganshina just as Jaegerists have seized control. After taking a
        huge blow from a surprise attack led by Eren, Marley swiftly acts to return the favor. With Zeke’s
        true plan revealed and a military forced under new rule, this battle might be fought on two fronts,
        and we'll soon discover where Eren's allegiances lie.</p>

      <p>Known in Japan as Shingeki no Kyojin, many years ago, the last remnants of humanity were forced
        to retreat behind the towering walls of a fortified city to escape the massive, man-eating Titans
        that roamed the land outside their fortress. Only the heroic members of the Scouting Legion dared
        to stray beyond the safety of the walls – but even those brave warriors seldom returned alive. Those
        within the city clung to the illusion of a peaceful existence until the day that dream was shattered,
        and their slim chance at survival was reduced to one horrifying choice: kill – or be devoured!</p>
