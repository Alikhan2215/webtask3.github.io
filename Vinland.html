  <p>The second season of the Vinland Saga anime television series is produced by MAPPA and based on
    the manga series of the same name by Makoto Yukimura. Despite the studio change, the series
    retained its main production staff from the previous season. The series is directed by Shūhei Yabuta,
    with Hiroshi Seko handling series composition, Takahiko Abiru designing the characters and Yutaka
    Yamada composing the music. Taking place a year after the events of the first season,
    the season primarily focuses on a slave from England named Einar as he meets the protagonist,
    Thorfinn, while working in a farm.</p>

  <p>After his father's death and the destruction of his village at the hands of English raiders,
    Einar wishes for a peaceful life with his family on their newly rebuilt farms. However, fate has
    other plans: his village is invaded once again. Einar watches helplessly as the marauding Danes
    burn his lands and slaughter his family. The invaders capture Einar and take him back to Denmark
    as a slave. Einar clings to his mother's final words to survive. He is purchased by Ketil, a kind
    slave owner and landlord who promises that Einar can regain his freedom in return for working in the
    fields. Soon, Einar encounters his new partner in farm cultivation—Thorfinn, a dejected and melancholic
    slave. As Einar and Thorfinn work together toward their freedom, they are haunted by both sins of the
    past and the ploys of the present. Yet they carry on, grasping for a glimmer of hope, redemption,
    and peace in a world that is nothing but unjust and unforgiving.</p>
