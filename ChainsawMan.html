  <p>Chainsaw Man is inarguably mangaka Tatsuki Fujimoto’s best-known work. Part 1 of the manga was
    serialized on Shōnen Jump+ from December 2018 to December 2020. Following this, Part 2 began
    serializing in July 2022 and is currently ongoing. The manga has published 120 chapters so far,
    108 of which have been collected in 13 tankobon volumes. Studio Mappa later adapted the series into
    an anime that was broadcasted from October to December 2022, after two years of being in production.</p>

  <p>Denji is robbed of a normal teenage life, left with nothing but his deadbeat father's overwhelming debt.
    His only companion is his pet, the chainsaw devil Pochita, with whom he slays devils for money that
    inevitably ends up in the yakuza's pockets. All Denji can do is dream of a good, simple life:
    one with delicious food and a beautiful girlfriend by his side. But an act of greedy betrayal by
    the yakuza leads to Denji's brutal, untimely death, crushing all hope of him ever achieving happiness.
    Remarkably, an old contract allows Pochita to merge with the deceased Denji and bestow devil
    powers on him, changing him into a hybrid able to transform his body parts into chainsaws.
    Because Denji's new abilities pose a significant risk to society, the Public Safety Bureau's elite
    devil hunter Makima takes him in, letting him live as long as he obeys her command. Guided by the
    promise of a content life alongside an attractive woman, Denji devotes everything and fights with all
    his might to make his naive dreams a reality.</p>
