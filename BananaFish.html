  <p>Banana Fish (バナナフィッシュ, stylized BANANA FISH) is an anime series based on the manga of the same
    name by Akimi Yoshida. It is produced by Fuji TV. The first season began airing July 6th, 2018, and
    the second season airing October 11th, 2018. The adaption revises the setting of the series from the
    1980s to the present day, adding modern references such as smartphones, and substituting the Vietnam
    War with the Iraq War. The series was produced as a part of a commemoration project to mark the 40th
    anniversary of Yoshida's debut as a manga artist.</p>

  <p>Aslan Jade Callenreese, known as Ash Lynx, was a runaway picked off the streets of New York City
    and raised by the infamous godfather of the mafia, Dino Golzine. Now 17 years old and the boss of
    his own gang, Ash begins investigating the mysterious "Banana Fish"—the same two words his older brother,
    Griffin, has muttered since his return from the Iraq War. However, his inquiries are hindered when Dino
    sends his men after Ash at an underground bar he uses as a hideout. At the bar, Skip, Ash's friend,
    introduces him to Shunichi Ibe and his assistant, Eiji Okumura, who are Japanese photographers
    reporting on American street gangs. However, their conversation is interrupted when Shorter Wong,
    one of Ash's allies, calls to warn him about Dino. Soon, Dino's men storm the bar, and in the ensuing
    chaos kidnap Skip and Eiji. Now, Ash must find a way to rescue them and continue his investigation
    into Banana Fish, but will his history with the mafia prevent him from succeeding?.</p>
