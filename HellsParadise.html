  <h1>Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku</h1>
  <img src="img/HellsParadise.png" alt="Hell's Paradise" width="200px">

  <p>Together, “Jigokuraku” represents a place or situation embodying both torment and bliss—a
    “Hell's Paradise”. This portmanteau serves as the title for a popular manga series written
    and illustrated by Yuji Kaku. “Jigokuraku” tells the tale of Gabimaru, a seasoned ninja, and
    a condemned criminal.</p>

  <p>Sentenced to death, ninja Gabimaru the Hollow finds himself apathetic. After leading a blood-soaked
    life, Gabimaru believes he deserves to die. However, every attempt to execute him inexplicably fails.
    Finally, Sagiri Yamada Asaemon, a fledgling member of a famed executioner clan, is asked to take
    Gabimaru's life; yet Sagiri makes no move to kill him as requested. Insisting that Gabimaru will
    not die because of his love for his wife, Sagiri instead offers him the chance to obtain a full
    pardon for his crimes. If he can travel to the island of Shinsekyo and obtain the Elixir of
    Life—which supposedly grants immortality—and bring it back for the shogun, then his freedom will
    be assured. But of the many who have traveled to Shinsekyo in search of the mythical Elixir, not a
    single person has returned sound of mind, if at all. Though unaware of the numerous dangers ahead,
    Gabimaru decides to accept the offer—alongside ten other death row convicts—in hope that he and his
    wife may finally live in peace.</p>
